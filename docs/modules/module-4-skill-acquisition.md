# Module 4 — Skill Acquisition Planner

> **The detailed living doc for M4.** A session working on M4 should load this + the lean [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md), not the whole repo. Full design rationale is in the spec; this doc is the **current build + how it fits together**.

- **Route:** `/` = the **rebuild** (`CmPlannerPage`); `/legacy` = the original engine skill chart (`SkillAcquisitionPage`, unedited).
- **Status:** **Rebuilt around umalator's vendored UI — Slice A + planner sidebar done 2026-06-16; compact target/stat sidebar follow-up done 2026-06-17; sidebar, track setup, and plan inventory polish done 2026-06-18.** `/` now shows a saved-plan inventory rail, the **light-theme CmPlan sidebar**, the **real umalator §0 race-track visualizer**, and a **race-setup customizer** (preset CM15/CM16 ⇄ fully-custom: 11 tracks → surface → distance cascade + ground/weather/season). The original engine **skill chart + sourcing** (detailed below) now lives at **`/legacy`**.
- **Rebuild spec:** [2026-06-16-m4-umalator-build-foundation-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-m4-umalator-build-foundation-design.md) — vendor umalator's working UI into our shell; shared `Build` core, two faces (`RealUma`=`RosterEntry` vs `CmPlan`=Build+planner layer); defer the CmPlan/Dexie bridge. Slice plans: [track](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-16-m4-slice-a-track.md), [planner sidebar](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-16-m4-planner-sidebar.md).
- **Latest sidebar polish handoff:** [2026-06-18-m4-sidebar-polish-handoff.md](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-m4-sidebar-polish-handoff.md) — accepted details for pink-spark inheritance rows, Uma search/epithet overlay, plan name/note/save controls, stat-icon colors, sidebar scrolling/cropping, wishlist clear icon, portrait sizing, and alt-outfit icon asset-id overrides.
- **Latest track setup card handoff:** [2026-06-18-m4-track-setup-card-handoff.md](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-m4-track-setup-card-handoff.md) — accepted details for custom-vs-preset plan auto-naming and uma-tools-style distance/layout labels such as `2,200m (Inner)`.
- **Latest plan inventory handoff:** [2026-06-18-m4-plan-inventory-card-handoff.md](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-m4-plan-inventory-card-handoff.md) — saved-plan grouping and rows, delete behavior, inventory settings toggle semantics, three-column sizing, and per-plan ground/weather/season restoration.
- **Original design (now `/legacy`):** [2026-06-14-m4-skill-acquisition-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-14-m4-skill-acquisition-design.md) §11 + [2026-06-15-m4-slice1-skill-chart.md](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-m4-slice1-skill-chart.md)
- **⚠️ Mockup = the visual spec:** [docs/mockups/m4-current.html](../mockups/m4-current.html) (committed — open in a browser). **Current fidelity ~25%** — the build ranks skills but lacks the design system, §0 track diagram, Uma chart, effect badges, left-panel runner/wishlist cards, skill-detail graphs, and the sourcing table. Build *to the mockup*; see CLAUDE.md → *Design fidelity* for the full gap (most of it needs no new data).

## Rebuild — what's live on `/` (2026-06-16, vendored umalator UI)

`CmPlannerPage` uses a three-column desktop shell: **Plan Inventory**, **Current Uma Plan**, then the original main planner column. The two left rails have equal width; the page maximum was expanded so adding the inventory rail does not reduce the main column from its earlier two-column width. The main column stacks shared **`cmp-plan-card`** panels: track, Race setup, unique-skill chart, and acquirable-skill chart. Race setup and charts are collapsible.

- **Plan inventory** ([src/features/cm-planner/PlanInventoryCard.tsx](../../src/features/cm-planner/PlanInventoryCard.tsx)) — saved `CmPlan` rows grouped into collapsible CM/course sections (`CM15`, `CM16`, or a custom label such as `Hanshin 2,200m (Inner)`). Rows show plan name, raw `SPD / STA / POW / GUT / WIT` numbers, target surface/distance/style aptitudes, and right-aligned per-plan JSON download + trash actions. The card header contains hover-expanding Upload / Download all / Delete all icons; each group header also provides a hover-expanding ZIP download for that group. ZIPs contain one JSON file per plan via `fflate`. Upload is additive and turns ID collisions into named copies rather than overwriting. Deleting the final item leaves a clean empty inventory; the provider creates an unsaved active draft instead of silently inserting another saved row.
- **Inventory settings** — a separate card below the inventory list contains the persisted **Apply track setup** sliding switch. It defaults on. Changing the switch only changes the preference; it does not immediately change Race setup. When enabled, the saved course and conditions are applied only when the user clicks an inventory item to load it again. When disabled, loading an item changes the active Uma plan but leaves the current Race setup untouched.
- **Saved race setup fields** — `CmPlan.cmRef` carries `courseId`, `surface`, `distance`, `condition` (ground), `weather`, and `season`. These values are saved independently per plan, including plans that share the same course but differ only by weather. Older JSON without `weather` remains valid and falls back to preset/current weather until resaved.
- **Planner sidebar** ([src/features/cm-planner/PlannerSidebar.tsx](../../src/features/cm-planner/PlannerSidebar.tsx)) — light-theme build planner for the active `CmPlan`: runner search by uma/epithet/unique skill with keyboard selection, right-aligned Role controls in the Runner heading row, compact editable stats with selected-uma growth bonuses, target surface/distance/style aptitudes stored in `sparkGoals.pink`, computed pink-spark requirement chips from target minus selected-uma base aptitude, icon-only mood dropdown, fixed native unique skill, and wishlist search/add/remove plus confirmed Delete all. The sidebar grows to its full content height and uses page scrolling instead of a nested scrollbar. The top controls provide an editable plan name, optional `Auto` name switch (generated name + read-only field while enabled), one-line auto-growing notes persisted in JSON, a left-aligned saved/unsaved state, an Auto-save switch that defaults off, and right-aligned Save / Save as / New actions. Plans that arrive with their exact generated name, including first-run and New Kitasan plans, default Auto on; custom names default it off, and manually turning it off remains respected for that plan. Save only generates a name when the field is blank; duplicate manual or generated names receive the first available `(N)` suffix. New creates a generated Kitasan Black baseline for the current race (`1200 / 900 / 1000 / 600 / 1100`, Turf A, current distance S, Front A, Great, no wishlist). Stat badges follow the game palette, including red-orange Stamina and pink Guts. Skill rows use in-game-like white/gold/unique plates and `SkillDetailDisclosure` for raw umalator conditions/effects.
- **§0 Race-track visualizer** — umalator's *real* SVG track, **vendored** into `src/features/planner/racetrack/vendor/` (slope/elevation profile, corner/straight bands, the four legs Early/Mid/Late/Last-spurt, distance ruler). Composed in our own [RaceTrackView.tsx](../../src/features/planner/racetrack/RaceTrackView.tsx), driven by `courseId`; lazy-loads the real engine `CourseData` via `@/sim/courseData`. Pure SVG — **no Tailwind/Base-UI** (d3 / i18n / `CourseService` replaced by tiny shims under `racetrack/shims/`; the 3 vendored layer files carry `// @ts-nocheck`).
- **Race-setup customizer** ([src/features/planner/race-setup/](../../src/features/planner/race-setup/)) — one panel: a **Preset** dropdown (CM15 Cancer Cup / CM16 Leo Cup, real conditions) that fills the controls, plus an always-visible **Track → Surface → Distance** cascade over all 11 tracks (incl. Ooi) from the engine catalog (`@/sim/courseCatalog` → `coursesService.getAllEntries`) + **Ground / Weather / Season** + a conditions readout. Editing any field away from an exact preset match blanks it to "— Custom —", resets stored custom race metadata to `CM0`, and makes plan auto-generation use the current course label (for example `Hanshin 2,200m (Inner)`) instead of stale `CM15`.
- **Track setup labels:** course dropdown options and condition chips use the engine/uma-tools course-layout code (`course`: none/inner/outer/outer-inner), so CM15 shows `2,200m (Inner)` rather than `2,200m (Medium)`. The separate handoff is [2026-06-18-m4-track-setup-card-handoff.md](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-m4-track-setup-card-handoff.md).
- **§1 Unique-skill chart** ([src/features/cm-planner/UmaChartPanel.tsx](../../src/features/cm-planner/UmaChartPanel.tsx)) — ranks Global umas by their **native unique skill's bashin L** on the selected track, **best of the 4 running styles** on a **fixed Global-capped reference runner** ([rankUmaChart.ts](../../src/core/rankUmaChart.ts), the `basinnhyou` model). **Runs only on a Run button** ([useUmaChart.ts](../../src/features/cm-planner/useUmaChart.ts), run-on-demand; `isStale` prompts a re-run when the track changes). **Plan-independent by design** — uses `REFERENCE_STATS` (all-1200, the JP cmdef clamped to Global's cap), *not* the active plan. Presented as a **collapsible VFalator-style sortable table** — columns Style / Min / Max / Mean / Median (click a header to sort), a per-row **Style dropdown** that re-ranks instantly with no re-sim, compact scrollable rows; each row renders the unique via `SkillDetailDisclosure` (now with **effect-chips**, Codex `d043011`); **`Select` writes `umaId`/`uniqueSkillId`** to the plan. **No new data** — candidates = `gameData.umas` ⋈ `loadUniqueSkillByUmaId()`; reuses `evalSkillDelta`/`SimClient`. Spec: [2026-06-16-m4-uma-chart-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-m4-uma-chart-design.md).
- **Skill chart (acquirable)** — `/` planner, below the Unique-skill chart. `SkillChartPanel` +
  `useSkillRank` + `rankSkillChart`: ranks white/gold/inherited skills by marginal L on the
  **plan build** (run-on-demand), with **SP cost** + **efficiency (L/100SP)** columns, sortable;
  variant families collapse to one row (`familyRepresentatives`); `+ target` adds via
  `addOrReplaceWishlistSkill` and stamps `projectedL` so the sidebar's L total moves; effect-chips
  on expand. `/legacy` keeps the original engine skill chart. Spec:
  [2026-06-17-m4-acquirable-skill-chart-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-m4-acquirable-skill-chart-design.md).
  Always-visible skill-type tag is a separate handoff
  ([2026-06-17-skill-plate-type-tag-handoff.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-skill-plate-type-tag-handoff.md)).
- **P3 honesty:** only Track + distance (→ course geometry) changes the drawn track; ground/weather/season feed the sim later, not the static diagram. The unique-skill chart's L is a **relative yardstick** vs the fixed reference runner, not an absolute prediction.
- **Deferred on the new page (next):** **card-hint sourcing + wishlist**, and **HP / velocity / skill-activation zones** on the track (needs the engine's per-frame run trace, not just `getSimCourse`). ~~White/gold Skill chart~~ — **DONE 2026-06-17** (`SkillChartPanel`, mounted on `/` below the Unique-skill chart; `/legacy` keeps the original).
- **Review follow-ups (deferred — 2026-06-16 `/code-review`, all low-severity/by-design):** non-numeric `courseId` → `NaN` is not validated in `resolveCourse` (latent — courseIds come from the catalog); `courseCatalog()` does no bundle-field validation; `PRESETS`/`TRACKS` are hardcoded rather than sourced from `cm_presets.json`/the engine (data-debt — the UI won't surface new CMs/tracks until they're added in code); race-setup's derived options + `courseCatalog()` aren't memoized (negligible at 107 courses); the app `main` width was bumped globally in `app.css` rather than scoped to the planner page. Fixed in that pass: empty-catalog desync, `distanceClass` threshold reuse, `frontType` type, `cap()` dedupe.

> **The sections below describe the original Slice-1 build, now served at `/legacy`.**

## Purpose & boundary

M4 is the **pre-run planner for the ideal build** — *"what should this build end up with, and is it reachable?"*. Discovery (what skills are worth targeting, ranked by real simulated length advantage) + sourcing (where to get them). **No SP constraint.**

It is **not** Module 2: M2 is the post-run, SP-limited min-max (pick the optimal affordable subset at a run's end). M4's L-ranking is the *discovery* engine; M2 does *purchase* optimization. See the [pipeline/boundary memory](../../CLAUDE.md) and spec §2.

The target skill list is an **output** of discovery, not an input — that's the core redesign vs. the old coverage-matrix UI this supersedes (spec §1).

## What's live (Slice 1)

2-column shell (`SkillAcquisitionPage`): a left **"Current Uma Plan"** sidebar mirrors the plan; the right column is the working area.

- **§1 Skill chart** — ranks the acquirable catalog (477 white/gold/inherited-unique skills, **Global only**) by **real simulated L** (length advantage / bashin) from the vendored engine. Streams top rows first, `0 L` vs `n/a` distinguished, gold ★ markers, base SP cost, search/rarity/"show every" filters, `+ target` to the wishlist, expandable row detail (conditions DSL + L mean/sample count).
- **Runner config** (left sidebar) — editable stats (spd/sta/pow/gut/wit), strategy, mood, and target aptitudes (distance/surface/strategy, default `A`).
- **§0 Race** — course summary + conditions (form only; **no track diagram** yet).
- **§3 Sourcing** — per wishlist skill, the support **cards that hint it** (tier/LB via coverage) + **⚠ gap** when none covers it.

## Architecture / file map

**Pure core (`src/core/`, unit-tested — P6):**
| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [rankSkillChart.ts](../../src/core/rankSkillChart.ts) | Streaming L-rank orchestrator over the catalog (injectable sim dep). `DEAD_L=0.1`, `DISCOVERY_NSAMPLES=30`. Per-skill try/catch → `n/a`. Sorts L desc, `n/a` last. |
| [simBuild.ts](../../src/core/simBuild.ts) | `planToSimBuild(plan)` / `simAptitudes(plan)` — `CmPlan` → engine `SimBuild` (raw stats + strategy + aptitudes from `sparkGoals.pink`). |
| [skillCatalog.ts](../../src/core/skillCatalog.ts) | `acquirableSkills(skills, server)` — white/gold/inherited-unique on the matching server (excludes `unique` + JP). |
| [sourcing.ts](../../src/core/sourcing.ts) | Card-hint reverse index + per-skill `sourcingForSkill` join (reuses `coverage.ts` tiering). |
| [cost.ts](../../src/core/cost.ts) (shared) | `effectiveSpCost(skill, level, sparkRates)`. |

**Feature layer (`src/features/skill-acq/`, thin renderers):**
| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [SkillAcquisitionPage.tsx](../../src/features/skill-acq/SkillAcquisitionPage.tsx) | 2-col shell; guards load/error. |
| [SkillChartPanel.tsx](../../src/features/skill-acq/SkillChartPanel.tsx) | §1 chart UI + filters; guards `spd > 0` before simming. |
| [useSkillChart.ts](../../src/features/skill-acq/useSkillChart.ts) | Hook driving `rankSkillChart` via the `SimClient` worker; streams rows; cancels on input change. |
| [RunnerConfigPanel.tsx](../../src/features/skill-acq/RunnerConfigPanel.tsx) | Stat/strategy/mood/aptitude editors (writes `sparkGoals.pink` via `setTargetAptitude`). |
| [SourcingPanel.tsx](../../src/features/skill-acq/SourcingPanel.tsx) | §3 card-hint chips + gap. |

Reused: `PlanHeaderPanel`/`SkillPicker` (from `skill-planner/`), `useActivePlan`, `useGameData`, `src/sim` (`SimClient`/`evalSkillDelta`/`makeDeltaCache`).

**Data flow:** `CmPlan` → `planToSimBuild` → `useSkillChart` → `SimClient` worker → `evalSkillDelta` (with-vs-without race on one seed) → streamed `SkillChartRow[]` → `SkillChartPanel`.

## Key mechanics & decisions

- **L = `evalSkillDelta(build, race, skillId, nsamples, seed?)`** — runs the race with vs. without the skill on the same seed; `bashin = Δposition / 2.5m`, averaged over Monte-Carlo samples. Returns `BashinStats {mean, median, min, max, nsamples, results}`.
- **`DISCOVERY_NSAMPLES = 30`** — discovery trades precision for speed. Measured: 200 samples ≈ 3.3 min for the full chart; 30 ≈ 36 s with top rows streaming in ~1–2 s. (M2 sets its own higher count for precision.) TODO(1b): progressive refine of the surviving top-N.
- **`0 L` vs `n/a` (P3)** — `nsamples === 0` ⇒ the engine **can't** evaluate it → `n/a` (never a misleading `0 L`). `mean ≤ DEAD_L (0.1)` ⇒ `zero`. Both addable when "show every skill" is on.
- **Shared Kitasan default** — first run, the New action, and the post-delete fallback use the same CM15 Kitasan baseline: `spd 1200 / sta 900 / pow 1000 / gut 600 / wit 1100`, Great mood, Turf A / Medium S / Front A. The untouched legacy empty/Pace starter is migrated automatically when it is the device's only saved plan. The engine **throws `firstPositionInLateRace` on a 0-speed runner**; the chart also guards `spd > 0` and shows an "enter your stats" prompt otherwise.
- **Aptitudes** read from `sparkGoals.pink` (default `A`), not `statProfile`.
- **Course geometry is embedded in the engine bundle** — `resolveCourse(courseId)` needs no external `course_data.json` for the sim.

## Deferred (Slice 1b+) — each gated on a named data dependency

| Deferred | Blocked on |
|---|---|
| ~~Effect-summary badges~~ + duration + L-vs-distance / speed graphs | **Effect-chips DONE 2026-06-16** (Codex `d043011`): skill effect/variant data baked into `skills.json` via `build-skills` + `upstream-types` → **effect-chips in `SkillDetailDisclosure`** (+ `skillFamilies.ts`). Duration → L-vs-distance / speed graphs still open. |
| ~~§1 **Uma chart**~~ | ✅ **DONE 2026-06-16** — the **unique-skill chart** shipped with **no new data** (ranks each uma's native unique by `evalSkillDelta` best-of-4 on a fixed reference; candidates = `gameData.umas` ⋈ `loadUniqueSkillByUmaId()`). |
| Uma base-aptitude "usable here" filter + §3 **uma-innate column** | **Base aptitudes + stat growth DONE 2026-06-17:** `scripts/build-umas.ts` bakes `aptitude` and `stat_bonus` from `scripts/borrowed/gametora/character-cards.json` into `umas.json` as `baseAptitudes` / `statGrowth`; the sidebar uses this for growth display and pink-spark requirement chips. Still open: innate skills, release dates, and the actual "usable here" filtering / innate-source columns. |
| §0 race-track diagram (SVG activation zones) | Engine `CourseData` has geometry; rendering is later-milestone work. |
| §5.2 stat-target auto-seed (`cm_stat_targets.json`) | User hand-enters stats for now. |
| Now / Upcoming / Future availability toggle | Needs per-record release dates (shared with M3). "Now" only for the slice. |
| Debuffer-specific L | Self-L with caveat (Ace/Hybrid honest) for now — spec §5.1. |

**Slice 1b is the natural next M4 step** and is gated primarily on sourcing innate skills/release dates, the white/gold skill chart, card-hint sourcing, duration/L-vs-distance data, and track activation overlays.

### Inventory load behavior

After a saved plan is loaded from Plan Inventory, every expanded `SkillDetailDisclosure` closes automatically. This includes the current Uma's unique skill, wishlist skills, unique-skill chart rows, and acquirable-skill chart rows. The collapse signal is emitted after `selectPlan()` succeeds and does not reset chart results, filters, or parent panel open/closed state.

## Gotchas (M4-specific)

- **0-speed runner throws** `firstPositionInLateRace` — never feed `evalSkillDelta` an all-zero build. `makeDefaultPlan` seeds non-zero stats; the chart guards `spd > 0`.
- **Pre-fix plans show the "enter stats" prompt** — any plan created before the default-stats seed has all-zero stats, so `/` shows *"Enter your runner's stats (Speed is required)"* instead of ranking. Fix: enter stats in the Runner panel, or create a new plan.
- **Old coverage UI removed (2026-06-15)** — the pre-engine `SkillPlannerPage` + `src/features/coverage/` + `src/features/inventory/` clusters (+ the `iconRetrofit` integration test that only exercised them) were deleted once the engine chart replaced them. `PlanHeaderPanel`/`SkillPicker` stayed (shared by the new page). Recover the coverage-matrix/inventory pattern from git history if Slice 1b needs it.

## Honest numbers (P3)

L is a **streaming estimate, not a verdict** — show "refining N/M samples" + an RNG caveat; never present `n/a` as `0 L`; JP-ahead skills are excluded from the Now chart (P4). Validate a few values vs VFalator before trusting (record in [docs/mechanics-notes.md](../mechanics-notes.md)).
