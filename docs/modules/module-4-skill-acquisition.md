# Module 4 — Skill Acquisition Planner

> **The detailed living doc for M4.** A session working on M4 should load this + the lean [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md), not the whole repo. Full design rationale is in the spec; this doc is the **current build + how it fits together**.

- **Route:** `/` = the **rebuild** (`CmPlannerPage`); `/legacy` = the original engine skill chart (`SkillAcquisitionPage`, unedited).
- **Status:** **Rebuilt around umalator's vendored UI — Slice A + planner sidebar done 2026-06-16; compact target/stat sidebar follow-up done 2026-06-17.** `/` now shows the **real umalator §0 race-track visualizer**, a **race-setup customizer** (preset CM15/CM16 ⇄ fully-custom: 11 tracks → distance cascade + ground/weather/season), and a **light-theme CmPlan sidebar** for runner, role, compact stat editing + growth, aptitude targets + pink-spark summary, mood, native unique, and wishlist. The original engine **skill chart + sourcing** (detailed below) now lives at **`/legacy`**.
- **Rebuild spec:** [2026-06-16-m4-umalator-build-foundation-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-m4-umalator-build-foundation-design.md) — vendor umalator's working UI into our shell; shared `Build` core, two faces (`RealUma`=`RosterEntry` vs `CmPlan`=Build+planner layer); defer the CmPlan/Dexie bridge. Slice plans: [track](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-16-m4-slice-a-track.md), [planner sidebar](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-16-m4-planner-sidebar.md).
- **Original design (now `/legacy`):** [2026-06-14-m4-skill-acquisition-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-14-m4-skill-acquisition-design.md) §11 + [2026-06-15-m4-slice1-skill-chart.md](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-m4-slice1-skill-chart.md)
- **⚠️ Mockup = the visual spec:** [docs/mockups/m4-current.html](../mockups/m4-current.html) (committed — open in a browser). **Current fidelity ~25%** — the build ranks skills but lacks the design system, §0 track diagram, Uma chart, effect badges, left-panel runner/wishlist cards, skill-detail graphs, and the sourcing table. Build *to the mockup*; see CLAUDE.md → *Design fidelity* for the full gap (most of it needs no new data).

## Rebuild — what's live on `/` (2026-06-16, vendored umalator UI)

`CmPlannerPage` = the CmPlan planner sidebar on the left; the right column is three stacked **`cmp-plan-card`** panels (one shared card grammar — see the *Planner-page card grammar* gotcha in CLAUDE.md): a **track card** (centered CM-preset title + the §0 race-track + centered condition chips), the **Race-setup** customizer, and the **unique-skill chart**. Race-setup and the chart are **collapsible** — the whole header bar toggles.

- **Planner sidebar** ([src/features/cm-planner/PlannerSidebar.tsx](../../src/features/cm-planner/PlannerSidebar.tsx)) — light-theme build planner for the active `CmPlan`: runner search by uma/epithet/unique skill with keyboard selection, role, compact editable stats with selected-uma growth bonuses, target surface/distance/style aptitudes stored in `sparkGoals.pink`, computed pink-spark requirement chips from target minus selected-uma base aptitude, icon-only mood dropdown, fixed native unique skill, and wishlist search/add/remove/clear. Skill rows use in-game-like white/gold/unique plates and `SkillDetailDisclosure` for raw umalator conditions/effects.
- **§0 Race-track visualizer** — umalator's *real* SVG track, **vendored** into `src/features/planner/racetrack/vendor/` (slope/elevation profile, corner/straight bands, the four legs Early/Mid/Late/Last-spurt, distance ruler). Composed in our own [RaceTrackView.tsx](../../src/features/planner/racetrack/RaceTrackView.tsx), driven by `courseId`; lazy-loads the real engine `CourseData` via `@/sim/courseData`. Pure SVG — **no Tailwind/Base-UI** (d3 / i18n / `CourseService` replaced by tiny shims under `racetrack/shims/`; the 3 vendored layer files carry `// @ts-nocheck`).
- **Race-setup customizer** ([src/features/planner/race-setup/](../../src/features/planner/race-setup/)) — one panel: a **Preset** dropdown (CM15 Cancer Cup / CM16 Leo Cup, real conditions) that fills the controls, plus an always-visible **Track → Surface → Distance** cascade over all 11 tracks (incl. Ooi) from the engine catalog (`@/sim/courseCatalog` → `coursesService.getAllEntries`) + **Ground / Weather / Season** + a conditions readout. Editing a field away from the preset blanks it to "— Custom —".
- **§1 Unique-skill chart** ([src/features/cm-planner/UmaChartPanel.tsx](../../src/features/cm-planner/UmaChartPanel.tsx)) — ranks Global umas by their **native unique skill's bashin L** on the selected track, **best of the 4 running styles** on a **fixed Global-capped reference runner** ([rankUmaChart.ts](../../src/core/rankUmaChart.ts), the `basinnhyou` model). **Runs only on a Run button** ([useUmaChart.ts](../../src/features/cm-planner/useUmaChart.ts), run-on-demand; `isStale` prompts a re-run when the track changes). **Plan-independent by design** — uses `REFERENCE_STATS` (all-1200, the JP cmdef clamped to Global's cap), *not* the active plan. Presented as a **collapsible VFalator-style sortable table** — columns Style / Min / Max / Mean / Median (click a header to sort), a per-row **Style dropdown** that re-ranks instantly with no re-sim, compact scrollable rows; each row renders the unique via `SkillDetailDisclosure` (now with **effect-chips**, Codex `d043011`); **`Select` writes `umaId`/`uniqueSkillId`** to the plan. **No new data** — candidates = `gameData.umas` ⋈ `loadUniqueSkillByUmaId()`; reuses `evalSkillDelta`/`SimClient`. Spec: [2026-06-16-m4-uma-chart-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-m4-uma-chart-design.md).
- **Skill chart (acquirable)** — `/` planner, below the Unique-skill chart. `SkillChartPanel` +
  `useSkillRank` + `rankSkillChart`: ranks white/gold/inherited skills by marginal L on the
  **plan build** (run-on-demand), with **SP cost** + **efficiency (L/100SP)** columns, sortable;
  variant families collapse to one row (`familyRepresentatives`); `+ target` adds via
  `addOrReplaceWishlistSkill` and stamps `projectedL` so the sidebar's L total moves; effect-chips
  on expand. `/legacy` keeps the original engine skill chart. Spec:
  [2026-06-17-m4-acquirable-skill-chart-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-m4-acquirable-skill-chart-design.md).
  Always-visible skill-type tag is a separate handoff
  ([2026-06-17-skill-plate-type-tag-handoff.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-skill-plate-type-tag-handoff.md)).
- **P3 honesty:** only Track + distance (→ course geometry) changes the drawn track; ground/weather/season feed the sim later, not the static diagram. The unique-skill chart's L is a **relative yardstick** vs the fixed reference runner, not an absolute prediction.
- **Deferred on the new page (next):** **card-hint sourcing + wishlist**, and **HP / velocity / skill-activation zones** on the track (needs the engine's per-frame run trace, not just `getSimCourse`). ~~White/gold Skill chart~~ — **DONE 2026-06-17** (`SkillChartPanel`, mounted on `/` below the Unique-skill chart; `/legacy` keeps the original).
- **Review follow-ups (deferred — 2026-06-16 `/code-review`, all low-severity/by-design):** non-numeric `courseId` → `NaN` is not validated in `resolveCourse` (latent — courseIds come from the catalog); `courseCatalog()` does no bundle-field validation; `PRESETS`/`TRACKS` are hardcoded rather than sourced from `cm_presets.json`/the engine (data-debt — the UI won't surface new CMs/tracks until they're added in code); race-setup's derived options + `courseCatalog()` aren't memoized (negligible at 107 courses); the app `main` width was bumped globally in `app.css` rather than scoped to the planner page. Fixed in that pass: empty-catalog desync, `distanceClass` threshold reuse, `frontType` type, `cap()` dedupe.

> **The sections below describe the original Slice-1 build, now served at `/legacy`.**

## Purpose & boundary

M4 is the **pre-run planner for the ideal build** — *"what should this build end up with, and is it reachable?"*. Discovery (what skills are worth targeting, ranked by real simulated length advantage) + sourcing (where to get them). **No SP constraint.**

It is **not** Module 2: M2 is the post-run, SP-limited min-max (pick the optimal affordable subset at a run's end). M4's L-ranking is the *discovery* engine; M2 does *purchase* optimization. See the [pipeline/boundary memory](../../CLAUDE.md) and spec §2.

The target skill list is an **output** of discovery, not an input — that's the core redesign vs. the old coverage-matrix UI this supersedes (spec §1).

## What's live (Slice 1)

2-column shell (`SkillAcquisitionPage`): a left **"Current Uma Plan"** sidebar mirrors the plan; the right column is the working area.

- **§1 Skill chart** — ranks the acquirable catalog (477 white/gold/inherited-unique skills, **Global only**) by **real simulated L** (length advantage / bashin) from the vendored engine. Streams top rows first, `0 L` vs `n/a` distinguished, gold ★ markers, base SP cost, search/rarity/"show every" filters, `+ target` to the wishlist, expandable row detail (conditions DSL + L mean/sample count).
- **Runner config** (left sidebar) — editable stats (spd/sta/pow/gut/wit), strategy, mood, and target aptitudes (distance/surface/strategy, default `A`).
- **§0 Race** — course summary + conditions (form only; **no track diagram** yet).
- **§3 Sourcing** — per wishlist skill, the support **cards that hint it** (tier/LB via coverage) + **⚠ gap** when none covers it.

## Architecture / file map

**Pure core (`src/core/`, unit-tested — P6):**
| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [rankSkillChart.ts](../../src/core/rankSkillChart.ts) | Streaming L-rank orchestrator over the catalog (injectable sim dep). `DEAD_L=0.1`, `DISCOVERY_NSAMPLES=30`. Per-skill try/catch → `n/a`. Sorts L desc, `n/a` last. |
| [simBuild.ts](../../src/core/simBuild.ts) | `planToSimBuild(plan)` / `simAptitudes(plan)` — `CmPlan` → engine `SimBuild` (raw stats + strategy + aptitudes from `sparkGoals.pink`). |
| [skillCatalog.ts](../../src/core/skillCatalog.ts) | `acquirableSkills(skills, server)` — white/gold/inherited-unique on the matching server (excludes `unique` + JP). |
| [sourcing.ts](../../src/core/sourcing.ts) | Card-hint reverse index + per-skill `sourcingForSkill` join (reuses `coverage.ts` tiering). |
| [cost.ts](../../src/core/cost.ts) (shared) | `effectiveSpCost(skill, level, sparkRates)`. |

**Feature layer (`src/features/skill-acq/`, thin renderers):**
| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [SkillAcquisitionPage.tsx](../../src/features/skill-acq/SkillAcquisitionPage.tsx) | 2-col shell; guards load/error. |
| [SkillChartPanel.tsx](../../src/features/skill-acq/SkillChartPanel.tsx) | §1 chart UI + filters; guards `spd > 0` before simming. |
| [useSkillChart.ts](../../src/features/skill-acq/useSkillChart.ts) | Hook driving `rankSkillChart` via the `SimClient` worker; streams rows; cancels on input change. |
| [RunnerConfigPanel.tsx](../../src/features/skill-acq/RunnerConfigPanel.tsx) | Stat/strategy/mood/aptitude editors (writes `sparkGoals.pink` via `setTargetAptitude`). |
| [SourcingPanel.tsx](../../src/features/skill-acq/SourcingPanel.tsx) | §3 card-hint chips + gap. |

Reused: `PlanHeaderPanel`/`SkillPicker` (from `skill-planner/`), `useActivePlan`, `useGameData`, `src/sim` (`SimClient`/`evalSkillDelta`/`makeDeltaCache`).

**Data flow:** `CmPlan` → `planToSimBuild` → `useSkillChart` → `SimClient` worker → `evalSkillDelta` (with-vs-without race on one seed) → streamed `SkillChartRow[]` → `SkillChartPanel`.

## Key mechanics & decisions

- **L = `evalSkillDelta(build, race, skillId, nsamples, seed?)`** — runs the race with vs. without the skill on the same seed; `bashin = Δposition / 2.5m`, averaged over Monte-Carlo samples. Returns `BashinStats {mean, median, min, max, nsamples, results}`.
- **`DISCOVERY_NSAMPLES = 30`** — discovery trades precision for speed. Measured: 200 samples ≈ 3.3 min for the full chart; 30 ≈ 36 s with top rows streaming in ~1–2 s. (M2 sets its own higher count for precision.) TODO(1b): progressive refine of the surviving top-N.
- **`0 L` vs `n/a` (P3)** — `nsamples === 0` ⇒ the engine **can't** evaluate it → `n/a` (never a misleading `0 L`). `mean ≤ DEAD_L (0.1)` ⇒ `zero`. Both addable when "show every skill" is on.
- **Default stats seeded** — `makeDefaultPlan` seeds `spd 1000 / sta 600 / pow 600 / gut 400 / wit 400`. The engine **throws `firstPositionInLateRace` on a 0-speed runner**; the chart also guards `spd > 0` and shows a "enter your stats" prompt otherwise.
- **Aptitudes** read from `sparkGoals.pink` (default `A`), not `statProfile`.
- **Course geometry is embedded in the engine bundle** — `resolveCourse(courseId)` needs no external `course_data.json` for the sim.

## Deferred (Slice 1b+) — each gated on a named data dependency

| Deferred | Blocked on |
|---|---|
| ~~Effect-summary badges~~ + duration + L-vs-distance / speed graphs | **Effect-chips DONE 2026-06-16** (Codex `d043011`): skill effect/variant data baked into `skills.json` via `build-skills` + `upstream-types` → **effect-chips in `SkillDetailDisclosure`** (+ `skillFamilies.ts`). Duration → L-vs-distance / speed graphs still open. |
| ~~§1 **Uma chart**~~ | ✅ **DONE 2026-06-16** — the **unique-skill chart** shipped with **no new data** (ranks each uma's native unique by `evalSkillDelta` best-of-4 on a fixed reference; candidates = `gameData.umas` ⋈ `loadUniqueSkillByUmaId()`). |
| Uma base-aptitude "usable here" filter + §3 **uma-innate column** | **Base aptitudes + stat growth DONE 2026-06-17:** `scripts/build-umas.ts` bakes `aptitude` and `stat_bonus` from `scripts/borrowed/gametora/character-cards.json` into `umas.json` as `baseAptitudes` / `statGrowth`; the sidebar uses this for growth display and pink-spark requirement chips. Still open: innate skills, release dates, and the actual "usable here" filtering / innate-source columns. |
| §0 race-track diagram (SVG activation zones) | Engine `CourseData` has geometry; rendering is later-milestone work. |
| §5.2 stat-target auto-seed (`cm_stat_targets.json`) | User hand-enters stats for now. |
| Now / Upcoming / Future availability toggle | Needs per-record release dates (shared with M3). "Now" only for the slice. |
| Debuffer-specific L | Self-L with caveat (Ace/Hybrid honest) for now — spec §5.1. |

**Slice 1b is the natural next M4 step** and is gated primarily on sourcing innate skills/release dates, the white/gold skill chart, card-hint sourcing, duration/L-vs-distance data, and track activation overlays.

## Gotchas (M4-specific)

- **0-speed runner throws** `firstPositionInLateRace` — never feed `evalSkillDelta` an all-zero build. `makeDefaultPlan` seeds non-zero stats; the chart guards `spd > 0`.
- **Pre-fix plans show the "enter stats" prompt** — any plan created before the default-stats seed has all-zero stats, so `/` shows *"Enter your runner's stats (Speed is required)"* instead of ranking. Fix: enter stats in the Runner panel, or create a new plan.
- **Old coverage UI removed (2026-06-15)** — the pre-engine `SkillPlannerPage` + `src/features/coverage/` + `src/features/inventory/` clusters (+ the `iconRetrofit` integration test that only exercised them) were deleted once the engine chart replaced them. `PlanHeaderPanel`/`SkillPicker` stayed (shared by the new page). Recover the coverage-matrix/inventory pattern from git history if Slice 1b needs it.

## Honest numbers (P3)

L is a **streaming estimate, not a verdict** — show "refining N/M samples" + an RNG caveat; never present `n/a` as `0 L`; JP-ahead skills are excluded from the Now chart (P4). Validate a few values vs VFalator before trusting (record in [docs/mechanics-notes.md](../mechanics-notes.md)).
