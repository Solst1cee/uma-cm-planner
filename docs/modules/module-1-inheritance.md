# Module 1 — Inheritance Planner

> Brief module doc. Expand into a detailed living doc (like [M4's](module-4-skill-acquisition.md)) when M1 build work starts.

- **Route:** not yet routed (nav shows **Inheritance** as a disabled stub).
- **Status:** **Plans 1–2 shipped 2026-06-15** (foundation). **Plans 3–5 are the project's current "Next".**
- **Spec:** [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-14-m1-inheritance-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-14-m1-inheritance-design.md) (design locked) + canonical [shared-data-model](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-shared-data-model.md).
- **⚠️ Mockup = the visual spec:** [docs/mockups/m1-inheritance.html](../mockups/m1-inheritance.html) (committed — open in a browser). **Current fidelity ~8%** — only a parents CRUD form exists; the pedigree tree, goal builder, roster filter, and compare-all are unbuilt. Affinity core *is* done ([src/core/affinity.ts](../../src/core/affinity.ts)); most remaining work is UI, buildable now. See CLAUDE.md → *Design fidelity*.

## Purpose

Pedigree-aware parent/grandparent hunting: given a plan's wishlist (skills to inherit) + stat-threshold spark goals, find the best own/borrowed parent pairs. Uses computed affinity + the sim.

## Shipped (Plans 1–2)

- **CmPlan reconciliation** — `CmPlan` migrated to the canonical SSOT (`race`→`cmRef`, `targetSkills`→`wishlist`, `requiredAptitudes`→`sparkGoals.pink`, `chosenParents`→`parents.{a,b}`); db **v2**; export **v2**. `src/core/cost.ts` extracted (Fast Learner → additive). Plan: [2026-06-15-cmplan-reconciliation.md](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-cmplan-reconciliation.md).
- **Affinity core** — [src/core/affinity.ts](../../src/core/affinity.ts) (clean-room `aff2`/`aff3`/member-scores/△○◎ tiers from `succession_relation`) + generated `public/data/affinity.json`. **Static only** (dynamic +3 / shared-G1-win deferred — the planner has no race history). Plan: [2026-06-15-affinity-core.md](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-affinity-core.md).

## M1.0 affinity core (2026-06-25)

Four pure additions landed on `feat/m1.0-affinity-core` (merged to main 2026-06-25):

- **`src/core/winBonus.ts`** — 2.0 G1-only win-bonus (+3 per shared G1 win, capped); `sharedG1` helper + `computeWinBonus`.
- **`src/core/lineageAffinity.ts`** — adapter that assembles a `Lineage` from a `CmPlan` (reads `Parent.wonRaces`, grandparents) and calls `affinity.ts` to produce the full `LineageAffinity` including `memberScores`.
- **`src/core/spark.ts`** — per-member `memberAffinity` resolver passed into `sparkChance` opts; de-approximates the earlier per-parent average with the exact per-member value.
- **Rental target-tier helper** — `tierThreshold` / `affinityNeededForTier` in `src/core/affinity.ts`: given a target tier (△/○/◎), returns the affinity score needed and how far a plan is from it.

The 2.0 affinity model is **logic-complete**. It is **data-gated** on two follow-ons: (1) the UmaExtractor `wonRaces` import so real win-history flows in, and (2) the S1 base-relation refresh (engine v0.18.0) which updates the underlying `succession_relation` data. Until those land, the win-bonus and per-member scores are computed correctly but default to zero won-races.

Validated: `winBonus` synthetic fixtures, `spark.ts` de-approx, rental-tier thresholds. See [docs/mechanics-notes.md](../mechanics-notes.md) §3 for the locked affinity numbers; spec/plan: [2026-06-25 M1.0 spec](../superpowers/specs/) (dated 2026-06-25).

## M1.5 "Your deck" card (2026-06-26)

The center-column **"Your deck"** panel landed: a 6-slot support-card deck with
drag-drop (HTML5 DnD `text/card-id`), per-slot limit-break diamond steppers,
remove/clear, and named templates. State is a dedicated `DeckState` (NOT
`CmPlan.lockedDeckSlots` — that is M4's suggester concept), **autosaved per active
plan** to `localStorage` (`scb_deck:<planId>`), with templates in `scb_profiles`.
Files: `deckOps.ts` (pure), `useDeckState.ts` (persistence), `YourDeckCard.tsx`
(provider-free panel). The fill seam `addCardToDeck(cardId)` + the drop target are
built and tested; the interactive drag *source* / "+ Add" button arrive with **M1.6**
(support-card pool). Spec/plan: 2026-06-26-m1-5-your-deck-card.

## Next (Plans 3–5)

3. **Nested `Parent` + roster store migration** — flat→nested `Parent`/`ParentSparks`, `parents` Dexie store → `roster` (`RosterEntry`). **Carries the open grandparent-sourcing design decision** (a parent's grandparents come from the parent-veteran's own parents, not an inline form).
4. **Roster import + residual spark-goal search-builder + pairwise compare** (uses the affinity core + `runVacuumCompare`).
5. **M1 UI** — pedigree view, search-builder, compare-all, roster filter.

## Gotchas

- `relation_point` values are **1/2/7** (not uniformly 2) — affinity sums the real per-type point.
- `scripts/borrowed/relation*.json` are committed (deviation from the fetch-only borrowed pattern) because `spikes/` is gitignored/absent in worktrees.
- The flat→nested `Parent` rewrite is M1 Plan 3's job (Plan 1 deliberately kept `Parent` flat).
